## Installation
This code includes feature of python >= 3.8, please make sure to have a compatible version of python.
### Dependencies
The dependencies of this project are listed in the file `requirements.txt`. I recommend you to use a
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/library/venv.html) yet you only need to run `pip install -r
requirements.txt` having a `venv` or not.
### Run code
The main code with the user interface is in `main.py`, however, each independent file (except initialization ones)
contains a sample code.
## Use
### Main program
First, all the files contain in the folder `/graphs` will be display by the program. Then you'll be asked to choose one,
If the input isn't an integer, the program will display *wrong error* then repeat the question. If the requested graph
doesn't exist (wrong index), the program will display *Index out of range* and repeat the question.

***program as requested by the teacher, todo***
### Sample programs
Samples programs are without interactions, those are juste used for demonstration.
